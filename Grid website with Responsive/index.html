    <div class="para">
        <p>A home appliance, also referred to as a domestic appliance, an electric appliance or a
            household appliance,[1] is a
            machine which assists in household functions[2] such as cooking, cleaning and food preservation.

            Appliances are divided into three types: small appliances, major appliances (also known as
            white goods)[3] and
            consumer electronics (brown goods).
            While many appliances have existed for centuries, the self-contained electric or gas powered appliances are
            a
            uniquely American innovation that emerged in the twentieth century. The development of these appliances is
            tied
            to the disappearance of full-time domestic servants and the desire to reduce the time-consuming activities
            in
            pursuit of more recreational time. In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances included washing
            machines,
            water heaters, refrigerators, kettles and sewing machines. The invention of Earl Richardson's small electric
            clothes iron in 1903 gave a small initial boost to the home appliance industry. In the Post–World War II
            economic expansion, the domestic use of dishwashers, and clothes dryers were part of a shift for
            convenience.
            Increasing discretionary income was reflected by a rise in miscellaneous home
            appliances.[8][9][self-published
            source]

            In America during the 1980s, the industry shipped $1.5 billion worth of goods each year and employed over
            14,000
            workers, with revenues doubling between 1982 and 1990 to $3.3 billion. Throughout this period, companies
            merged
            and acquired one another to reduce research and production costs and eliminate competitors, resulting in
            antitrust legislation.

            The United States Department of Energy reviews compliance with the National Appliance Energy Conservation
            Act of
            1987, which required manufacturers to reduce the energy consumption of the appliances by 25% every five
            years.[8]

            In the 1990s, the appliance industry was very consolidated, with over 90% of the products being sold by just
            five companies. For example, in 1991, dishwasher manufacturing market share was split between General
            Electric
            with 40% market share, Whirlpool with 31%, Electrolux with 20%, Maytag with 7% and Thermador with just 2%.
